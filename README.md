# 🌐 Personal Homepage Project

This project is a simple yet elegant personal homepage built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Bootstrap**.  
It was developed as part of CS50’s Web Programming assignment and showcases my profile, hobbies, and contact information.

## 📖 Overview

The website is composed of **four interconnected pages**:

1. **Home (`index.html`)** – A welcoming introduction to the site with navigation links and a JavaScript-powered interactive button.  
2. **About (`about.html`)** – A short description about me, my background, and an image.  
3. **Hobby (`hobby.html`)** – Highlights one of my favorite hobbies with a quote and styled text.  
4. **Contact (`contact.html`)** – A functional form styled with Bootstrap and validated using JavaScript.

The site is fully responsive and works seamlessly across devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
